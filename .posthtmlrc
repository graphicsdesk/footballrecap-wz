In a game that featured inconsistent play from junior quarterback Chase Goodwin, the deciding factor proved to be the Light Blue’s defensive inability to stop the rush. Allowing 232 yards and five touchdowns, Columbia fell in a resounding 38-14 beatdown."

Despite the defense’s continued struggles to stop the running game, the Light Blue pulled away with a win largely due to the team’s strong pass defense, which picked Hoya quarterback Dez Thomas II three times and limited him to just 67 yards through the air. The Lions secured their first victory of the season in a 19-10 defensive battle."

Goodwin once again struggled against the Tigers, throwing interceptions on back-to-back drives to end the first half.
